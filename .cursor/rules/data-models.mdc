## Core Data Models

### Item Specification Model
Defines the foundational structure for items with:
- Attributes dictionary storing enum, number, boolean and string values
- Modifiers list containing metric adjustments and stacking rules
- Conditions that determine when modifiers should be applied
- Metadata for tracking and identification

Importance Score: 95

### Metric Modifiers Model
Represents modifications to item metrics:
- Operation type (increase, multiply, decrease etc.)
- Numeric value to apply
- Stacking behavior rules
- Priority for application order
- Conditional triggers

Importance Score: 90

### Evaluation Results Model
Captures the complete state of metric calculations:
- Final computed metric values
- Modifier application traces
- Intermediate calculation states
- Applied condition results

Importance Score: 85

### Snapshot Model 
Provides a flattened view combining:
- Original item attributes
- Computed metric values
- Applied modifier effects
- Evaluation metadata

Importance Score: 80
