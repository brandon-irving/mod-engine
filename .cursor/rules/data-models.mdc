### Core Data Structures

#### Item Specification Model (Importance: 95)
- Defines the fundamental structure of items with attributes and modifiers
- Supports type-safe attribute definitions for enums, numbers, strings and booleans
- Includes validation constraints like min/max values and allowed patterns
- Enables conditional modifiers based on attribute values

#### Modifier Model (Importance: 90)
- Represents modifications to item metrics
- Contains operation type, value, and priority
- Supports stacking rules for combining multiple modifiers
- Includes conditional logic for selective application

#### Evaluation Results Model (Importance: 85) 
- Captures computed metrics after modifier application
- Maintains trace of applied modifiers and their effects
- Supports serializable format for storage/transmission
- Includes intermediate calculation states for debugging

#### Attribute Schema Model (Importance: 80)
- Defines validation rules for different attribute types
- Supports enum values with cardinality constraints
- Enables number ranges with min/max bounds
- Allows string patterns with regex validation

File Paths:
- `src/types.ts`: Core type definitions
- `src/evaluation.ts`: Evaluation result structures
- `src/serialization.ts`: Serialization formats
- `src/snapshot.ts`: Snapshot representations

### Validation Rules

- Attributes must conform to their defined schemas
- Modifier values must be finite numbers
- Operations must be registered and valid
- Metrics must be present in final evaluation
- Enum values must be within allowed sets
- Number values must be within defined bounds

### Serialization Format

- Version-controlled serialization scheme
- Deep cloning support for complex objects
- Flat snapshot generation for storage/analysis
- Type-safe deserialization with validation
