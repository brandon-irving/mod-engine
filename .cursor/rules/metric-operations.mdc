# metric-operations

### Core Operation System (Importance: 95)
- Built-in operations (sum, multiply, subtract) with defined precedence rules
- Operation stacking behavior controls how multiple modifiers combine
- Registration system ensures all operations are properly declared before use
- Precedence rules determine evaluation order across different operation types

### Custom Operations (Importance: 90)
Located in `examples/custom-operations.ts`:
- Power Operation: Raises current value to modifier's power
- Min/Max Operations: Takes minimum/maximum between current and modifier values 
- Clamp Operation: Restricts values based on item Level attribute
- Operation precedence controls application order of custom operations

### Modifier Stacking Logic (Importance: 85)
Located in `src/evaluation.ts`:
- Groups modifiers by stacking keys to prevent duplicate effects
- Applies unique stacking behavior per operation type
- Handles priority-based modifier application
- Validates numeric results, rejecting NaN/Infinity values

### Operation Registration System (Importance: 80)
Located in `examples/enforced-operations.ts`:
- Strict validation ensuring all declared operations are registered
- Type-safe operation registration using builder pattern
- Bulk registration capability for multiple operations
- Runtime validation of operation completeness

### Operation Evaluation (Importance: 75)
- Sequential application of operations based on precedence
- Handles conditional operation application
- Validates operation results against configuration rules
- Maintains operation history for debugging/tracing

- src/operations.ts
