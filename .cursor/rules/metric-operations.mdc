# metric-operations

The metric operations system provides specialized logic for modifying and calculating item metrics through:

### Core Operation Types
1. Built-in Operations (Importance: 85)
- Standard operations like `increase`, `multiply`, `decrease` with defined precedence 
- Validation ensures numeric safety (no NaN/Infinity)
- Operations stack according to priority rules

2. Custom Operations (Importance: 90) 
- User-defined operations like `pow`, `min`, `max`, `clamp`
- Context-aware calculations based on item attributes
- Operations must be registered before engine usage

### Stacking Behavior (Importance: 95)
- Priority-based application of modifiers
- Unique stacking constraints prevent duplicate effects
- Conditional modifiers based on item attributes
- Tracked modifier application with before/after values

### Operation Registration (Importance: 80)
- Strict validation ensures all operations are registered
- Type-safe builder patterns prevent runtime errors
- Bulk registration support for operation sets
