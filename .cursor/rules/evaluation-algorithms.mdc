# evaluation-algorithms

The evaluation algorithms system handles computation of metrics through several key components:

### Modifier Processing (Importance: 95)
- Filters modifiers based on conditions and stacking rules
- Groups modifiers by custom stacking keys
- Sorts by priority and operation precedence
- Validates numeric results, rejecting NaN/Infinity values
- Enforces metric completeness after evaluation

File: `src/evaluation.ts`

### Operation Management (Importance: 90)
- Custom mathematical operations:
  - Power: Raises value to modifier power
  - Min/Max: Takes min/max between current and modifier
  - Clamp: Caps value based on item level
- Enforced operation registration with precedence values
- Type-safe operation validation during engine building

Files: 
- `src/operations.ts`
- `examples/custom-operations.ts`

### Snapshot Generation (Importance: 85)
- Generates flat, predictable data structures combining:
  - Computed metrics
  - Original attributes  
  - Applied modifiers
- Used for:
  - API responses
  - Database storage
  - Analytics aggregation
  - Test assertions
  - Caching computed values
  - CSV exports

Files:
- `src/snapshot.ts`
- `examples/snapshot-demo.ts`

### Result Explanation (Importance: 75)
- Transforms evaluation results into stable "AppliedTrace" format
- Maps computation steps without recalculation
- Provides debugging and UI-friendly output structure

File: `src/explain.ts`
