# evaluation-algorithms

Core evaluation algorithms handling metric calculations and modifier applications:

### Metric Evaluation Process (Importance: 95)
- Processes item specifications through a pipeline of modifier applications
- Applies modifiers based on priority and precedence rules
- Handles conditional modifiers using attribute-based evaluation 
- Tracks modifier application history for debugging/analysis
- Validates final metric values against configuration rules

### Modifier Stacking System (Importance: 90)
- Implements complex stacking rules for combining multiple modifiers
- Supports unique stacking constraints to prevent duplicate effects
- Applies priority-based ordering for modifier application
- Handles conditional stacking based on item attributes

### Custom Operation Processing (Importance: 85)
- Executes domain-specific operations like `pow`, `min`, `max`, `clamp`
- Supports context-aware calculations using item attributes
- Enforces precedence rules between different operation types
- Validates operation results for numeric safety

### Condition Evaluation Engine (Importance: 80)
- Evaluates complex logical conditions against item attributes
- Supports operators for equality, inclusion, containment, comparison
- Handles nested AND/OR/NOT conditions
- Validates condition structure and references

### Snapshot Generation (Importance: 75)
- Creates flattened item representations combining metrics and attributes
- Generates predictable structures for API responses/storage
- Ensures type safety for snapshot property access
- Preserves computational history for analysis
