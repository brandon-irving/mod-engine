## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The Mod-Engine project implements a system for evaluating and applying modifiers to items with attributes, focusing on three core business domains:

## Core Evaluation System
- Processes modifiers based on stacking rules and priorities
- Applies conditional logic to determine which modifiers are active
- Validates attribute values against defined schemas
- Generates flat data snapshots for analytics and storage

## Custom Operations Framework
- Allows definition of domain-specific mathematical operations
- Enforces operation registration before engine creation
- Implements power, min, max, and clamp operations
- Manages operation precedence and validation

## Item Configuration System
- Provides type-safe attribute definition and validation
- Supports complex conditional modifiers based on item state
- Implements versioned serialization for compatibility
- Enables fluent specification building with nested conditions

Critical file paths:
```
src/evaluation.ts          - Core modifier evaluation logic
src/operations.ts         - Custom operation definitions
src/validation.ts        - Attribute/modifier validation
src/snapshot.ts         - Flat data structure generation
```

The system's primary business value lies in:
1. Deterministic modifier stacking for predictable calculations
2. Conditional modifier application based on item attributes
3. Type-safe configuration of complex rule systems
4. Flat data generation for analytics and storage
5. Versioned serialization for data compatibility

Business domains served:
- RPG systems (character stats, equipment modifiers)
- Financial modeling (fee calculations, discount rules)
- Game balancing (buff/debuff systems)
- Configuration engines (conditional settings)
